 * Base type for Build and Atom game states.  These states use the Object Oriented state pattern, please see
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern.  It is also described in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
 * Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma et al.  The basic idea here is that the game challenges act as the state of the
 * game model, and stimuli from the user, such as submitting an answer, are submitted to the states via the API
 * defined below.
